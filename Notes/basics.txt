The fundamental theorm of arithmatic:-
  every number can be broken down to smaller number which is always prime numbers
  30=2+2+2+..+2(15 times)
  30=3+3+...+3(10 times)
  30=5+5+..+5(6 times)
  than we can multiply these number to built 30

The euclids algorithm:-
Q:
  if i have 2 bricks of size 32 and 12 ,you want to divide it both in equal part such that no remainder is left ,what will be the largest size of brick?
  
  32=12.2+8
  12=8.1+4
  8=4.2+0   so 4 is the largest brick we can use 
  
Ans:
  if
